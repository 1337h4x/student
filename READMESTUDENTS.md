Hi everyone, this is Elizabeth. I'm not going to be here for the first 30 minutes of class.
I have given you all access to edit the repository without making a pull request, but remember to make a pull anyway if you want to make any major edits.

Here's what you should do today:
Decide what Student pages to put on the website
Make those new pages to link to each-other

EVERYONE should make at least 2 commits today.

Good luck!
